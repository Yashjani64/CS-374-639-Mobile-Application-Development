This is my Application Submission for midterm.

I have Uploaded the following file in the ROOT 
1)Blue Print,
2)Ouput ScreenShorts,
3)Application Code,
4) APK file,

I have developed an application with only one screen that converts dollars into euros in order to make it easier for users and minimize their efforts. 
In my work, I initially inserted an image that did  include my name due to the name's negative impact on its appearance. Consequently, 
I made the decision to remove my name from the image in order to achieve a more minimalistic and pleasing look.

Thank you!
